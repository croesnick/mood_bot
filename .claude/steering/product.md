# Product Vision: MoodBot

## Overview

MoodBot is an educational hardware robot project designed for hands-on learning of embedded systems, hardware interfacing, and AI integration using Elixir and Nerves.

## Primary Purpose

A tinkering platform that demonstrates how to build interactive hardware projects with modern functional programming, serving as both a learning journey and a foundation for creative extensions.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Parent-child teams**: Learning embedded programming together through a tangible, interactive project
- **Project creator and family**: Personal exploration of Elixir, embedded systems, Nerves, and AI integration
- **Curious tinkerers**: Developers interested in exploring hardware programming without C complexity

### Secondary Users
- **Elixir community**: Demonstrating Elixir's capabilities in embedded/IoT contexts
- **Educators**: Using as a teaching example for hardware abstraction and driver development
- **Hardware enthusiasts**: Seeking inspiration or foundation for similar projects

## Learning Objectives

### Core Technical Skills
1. **Hardware Interfacing**: Learn to connect and control devices via standard interfaces (GPIO, SPI)
2. **Driver Development**: Write device drivers and implement Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL)
3. **Elixir for Embedded**: Demonstrate Elixir's strengths in embedded systems development

### Practical Outcomes
- Understanding of SPI communication protocols
- Experience with GPIO pin control and management
- Knowledge of OTP patterns applied to hardware control
- Appreciation for hardware abstraction in cross-platform development
- Learn how to deploy AI models to embedded hardware using Nerves and axon/bumblebee/...
- Learn how to build vertical software slices of AI-first features, like mood detection via camera and mimicing to the screen

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Indicator
**Extensibility**: MoodBot is successful if it becomes easy for users (especially kids) to extend with their own ideas for hardware interaction with the real world.

### Secondary Indicators
- Clear learning progression from basic concepts to advanced implementations
- Successful hardware-software integration without embedded C knowledge
- Community adoption and derivative projects
- Educational value demonstrated through guided documentation

## Product Philosophy

### Didactic Approach
Every aspect of MoodBot should guide readers through setup and functionality, ensuring each step teaches something valuable about embedded systems, hardware interfacing, or Elixir patterns.

### Accessibility Over Complexity
Prioritize making embedded programming approachable while maintaining technical accuracy and educational depth.

### Real-World Interaction
Focus on tangible, interactive features that demonstrate practical applications of embedded programming concepts.

## Future Vision

### AI Integration Goals
- **On-device processing**: Ideally implement speech-to-text and Vision Language Models directly on the Raspberry Pi
- **Fallback flexibility**: Graceful degradation to remote AI services when hardware limitations require it
- **Research-driven**: Explore and document Raspberry Pi AI capabilities as they evolve

### Extension Opportunities
MoodBot should serve as a platform for:
- Additional sensor integration
- Advanced AI behaviors
- Interactive learning experiences
- Community-contributed enhancements
- Educational curriculum development

## Value Proposition

MoodBot bridges the gap between software development and hardware programming, making embedded systems accessible through familiar functional programming patterns while delivering a tangible, engaging learning experience.
