# TTS: text-to-speech

MoodBot shall be able to convert text to speech and output it via its audio device.

Requires: [audio-output](./audio-output.md)

## Research

- Early 2024: Currently, there aren't native Elixir text-to-speech AI tools available, though the infrastructure (via Nx and Bumblebee) exists to potentially support them in the future.

- Late 2024: Support for TTS in Bumblebee has been requested, but is not there yet.
