# MoodBot

Ever had your kid ask for a robot — and thought, “Hey… maybe we could build one together”?

MoodBot is the result of that idea: a little robot built with Elixir, Nerves, a Raspberry Pi, and some help from AI. It talks using text-to-speech, shows its mood on an e-ink display, and grows over time — from basic GenServers to more playful, AI-powered behavior.

It’s not just about the end result — it’s also about exploring hardware, learning by doing, and seeing how far curiosity (and a few good tools) can take you.
